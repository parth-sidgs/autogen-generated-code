Okay

**Review Summary:**

The code is well-written and efficiently implements the binary search approach to find the median of two sorted arrays. It addresses edge cases effectively, including empty arrays and scenarios where one array is significantly shorter than the other. The code is also well-documented, explaining the logic, time and space complexity, and potential exceptions.  The use of `-float('inf')` and `float('inf')` simplifies the comparisons and avoids extra checks for boundary conditions. Swapping the arrays to ensure `nums1` is shorter is a good optimization. The time and space complexity analysis in the docstring is accurate.
